<h1> About Robert</h1>
<hr />
<p>
    Hello!
    <br /><br />
    I'm Robert and is a UX Game Designer turned web developer. (or at least aspiring to).<br />
    My strong point that I am bringing with me from my designer background is the UX part.<br />
    I can't remember how many times I left homepages without finding or understanding<br />
    how to get what I was there for.   
</p>
<p>
    So I will put a strong focus on making user friendly websites, that will make sure that<br />
    no one will close a website made by me without finding and getting what they came for.<br />
    Unless of course, what they were looking for was never there in the first place.
